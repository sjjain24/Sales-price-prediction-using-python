Introduction
This project focuses on predicting sales by analyzing the impact of advertising budgets allocated to TV, Radio, and Newspaper. The goal is to build a forecasting model using linear regression and assess its performance.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Advertising Dataset. It contains data on advertising budgets and corresponding sales.

Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing involves tasks like handling duplicate entries and checking for missing values.

Outlier Analysis
Outlier analysis is conducted to identify and understand potential outliers in the data. Box plots are used to visualize the distribution of the advertising budgets and sales.

Data Visualization
Data visualization helps understand the relationships between advertising budgets (TV, Radio, and Newspaper) and sales. Scatter plots and heatmaps are used to visualize these relationships.

Building the Forecasting Model
The project utilizes linear regression, a supervised machine learning algorithm, to build the forecasting model. Features include advertising budgets, and the target variable is sales.

Learn the Model
The model is trained using the training dataset to learn the relationship between advertising budgets and sales.

Predicting Sales
The trained model is used to predict sales based on new data points.

Testing the Model
The model's performance is evaluated using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and the Coefficient of Determination (R-squared).

Metrics
Mean Squared Error (MSE): Measures the average squared difference between predicted and actual values. A lower MSE indicates a better fit.
Coefficient of Determination (R-squared): Measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables.
